Rules,,,,,,,,,
"// 0. First of all, Take a quick look at 'register' and 'login' sheet to get the feeling, then come back for more details",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"1. You can comment anywhere as long as you don't fill in all columns. (The python script will ignore incomplete rows, thus allows us to use as comments)",,,,,,,,,
(incomplete row = a row that has empty column),,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
...So you can do something like:,,,,,,,,,
1.1. This,,,,,,,,,
,1.2 Also this,,,,,,,,Sky is the limit...
,,,,1.3 Even this...,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"2. From rule 1., It means you can have many empty rows as you want!",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
3. We can use any format & any background colors,,,,,,,,,
"3.1 Like this,",,,,,,,,,
,,and this.,,,,,,,
"3.2 This makes it ideals to remind us of unfinished translation, so we could do something like this in case you don't know how to say hello in france yet:",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
text_hello,Hello,สวัสดี,Hello(?),,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"// 4. IMPORTANT: If your comment (even in the first column) has many commas (','), It could mess up generated csv files. E.g. Those comments could be considered as valid row.",,,,,,,,,
"SOLUTION: Use // On the first column to force ignore. However, just restrain yourself from using it. Just use short, simple term without comma",,,,,,,,,
"// Like this, will be, ok, even if, it has, many commas, alright.",,,,,,,,,
"// So, from now on, I will use // for verbose sentences with a lot of commas to prevent it messing up with my actual keys",,,,,,,,,
"// 5. Different sheets can be used as different domains/features in your app. E.g. home, register, login, messaging, setting, profile, alert, others.",,,,,,,,,
// 5.1 You can have duplicated keys between different sheets. Because all keys will finally be prepended with sheet name. E.g. text_hello in this sheet is finally --->  intro_text_hello,,,,,,,,,
"// 5.2 Thus, name a sheet without special characters!",,,,,,,,,
// 5.3 Don't duplicate keys in the same sheet. Prepend by subdomain to distinguish them.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
// Guidelines For developers:,,,,,,,,,
// 1. Just remember that each sheet will eventually be turned into plain .csv files.,,,,,,,,,
"// 2. In setting.json, we specify LANG_KEYS as ["en", "th", "fr"]",,,,,,,,,
"// 3. Our python scripts will split csv into arrays and look up language in that order: so index 0 => key, index 1 => en, 2 => th, 3 => fr",,,,,,,,,
"// 4. It will then check for value at index 1, 2, 3. If any of them is empty, that row is completely ignored.",,,,,,,,,
